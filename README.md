# Algo Expert Algorithms

This repository contains solutions to common algorithm problems that are frequently encountered in technical interviews and coding challenges. The solutions are implemented in Python, focusing on a variety of topics and data structures. 

## About

The `algo-expert-algorithms` repository is designed for developers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews. Each problem includes a solution to solve it, so as its Time and Space complexity.

### Topics Covered
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)
- Search Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Depth-First Search)
- Array Manipulation (e.g., Two Number Sum, Three Number Sum)
- String Manipulation (e.g., Caesar Cipher, Run-Length Encoding)
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Recursion
